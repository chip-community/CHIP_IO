chip-io (0.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix for Issue #63 where re-setting up a pin wasn't lining up with RPi.GPIO standards. Calling setup after the first time will now update direction.
  * README updates to point out the direction() function since that was missing

chip-io (0.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-enabled the polarity setting for PWM based upon Issue #61
  * Fixed a 1 letter bug was trying to write inverted to polarity when it wants inversed (such facepalm)
  * Cleaned up the polarity setting code to work when PWM is not enabled
  * Fixed the unit test for pwm to verify we can set polarity
